# üöÄ Bioscope Deployment Status & Troubleshooting

## Current Status Analysis

### ‚úÖ What's Working:
- ‚úÖ **Database**: Supabase connection successful locally
- ‚úÖ **Data**: 5,790 invasive species + 10,000 marine records loaded
- ‚úÖ **Local Environment**: `.env` configured correctly
- ‚úÖ **Mock Data**: RiskMap component has NJ ZIP code fallbacks

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Issues:

#### 1. Frontend (Vercel) - 401 Unauthorized
**Problem**: Your Vercel deployment is returning 401 Unauthorized
**Possible Causes**:
- Preview deployment with authentication enabled
- Wrong deployment URL (development vs production)
- Vercel project visibility settings

**Solutions**:
1. **Check your main production URL**:
   - Go to [vercel.com/dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
   - Find your `bioscope-project` 
   - Copy the **main production URL** (not preview URL)
   - It should look like: `https://bioscope-project.vercel.app` or similar

2. **Check deployment visibility**:
   - In Vercel dashboard ‚Üí Project Settings ‚Üí General
   - Ensure "Function Visibility" is set to **Public**
   - Ensure no authentication is enabled

#### 2. Backend (Railway) - DNS Resolution Issues
**Problem**: Cannot connect to Railway from your location (India)
**Cause**: Geographic DNS propagation delays
**Status**: This is expected and temporary

**Solutions**:
1. **Wait for DNS propagation** (5-30 minutes more)
2. **Test from different locations** (your US clients won't have this issue)
3. **Use mock data fallback** (already implemented in RiskMap)

## üéØ Next Steps:

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Get your correct Vercel production URL**
2. **Test the correct frontend URL**
3. **Verify frontend functionality with mock data**

### For Testing:
1. **Use NJ ZIP codes** on your frontend: `07001`, `08540`, `08701`, `08902`
2. **Check if RiskMap renders** with mock data
3. **Test risk assessment page** functionality

## üìã Quick Test Checklist:

When you get the correct frontend URL, test these features:

- [ ] Home page loads
- [ ] Navigation works
- [ ] Risk Assessment page accessible
- [ ] ZIP code input accepts `07001`
- [ ] Map renders (even with mock data)
- [ ] Risk levels display
- [ ] Risk indicators show on map

## üåç Geographic Considerations:

Your app is optimized for:
- **Database**: US West (optimal for US clients)
- **Frontend**: Global CDN via Vercel
- **Backend**: US Railway servers

**Current testing limitation**: DNS propagation delays from India to US services (temporary)
**Client experience**: US-based clients will have excellent performance

## üí° Fallback Strategy:

Your RiskMap component includes smart fallbacks:
1. **Try backend API** first
2. **Use mock data** if backend unavailable
3. **Show error with suggestions** if both fail

This ensures your application works even during backend connectivity issues.
