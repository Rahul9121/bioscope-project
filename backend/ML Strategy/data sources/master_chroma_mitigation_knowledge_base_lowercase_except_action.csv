invasive,high,"Implement Mechanical Control: Hand-pulling, mowing, cutting, prescribed burns."
invasive,moderate,"Biological control via approved insects (e.g., weevil Ceutorhynchus scrobicollis for garlic mustard)."
invasive,moderate,Chemical control via herbicides with NJDEP permit & certified applicator.
invasive,low,Target small populations manually to reduce habitat disturbance.
invasive,high,"Eradicate alien herbivores (e.g., rabbits, pigs) in isolated biodiversity-rich areas."
invasive,high,Use biological agents only after screening and monitoring; avoid persistent chemicals.
invasive,moderate,Use native dense planting to outcompete invasive species.
invasive,high,Avoid herbicide use near aquatic systems; favor manual/mechanical methods.
invasive,high,Control early before population gets large to reduce costs and habitat damage.
invasive,moderate,"For invasive vertebrates: use buffer crops, zoning, nighttime enclosures, and prey base management."
iucn,high,Consider assisted colonization in line with IUCN Conservation Translocation Group protocols
iucn,high,"Implement zoning, buffer crops, livestock fencing, and night enclosures"
iucn,moderate,"Prioritize rescue and return to original range, avoid translocation if possible"
iucn,high,Reintroduce near original habitat to minimize genetic and disease risk to local populations
iucn,high,"Use hazing, improve natural prey base, or relocate human communities"
iucn,all,"Follow WOAH sanitary protocols during care, transport, and release"
marine,high,Establish Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) to limit human interference in high-risk zones. Enforce seasonal restrictions on commercial fishing and offshore drilling activities.
marine,high,Mandate the use of low-impact marine vessels and enforce no-discharge zones to reduce pollution in sensitive marine habitats.
marine,moderate,"Implement mandatory marine spatial planning tools to balance marine recreation, fishing, and conservation priorities."
marine,moderate,"Promote green port initiatives to reduce harbor and vessel pollution (e.g., cold-ironing, alternative fuels)."
marine,low,Conduct periodic monitoring of marine water quality and promote stakeholder education in coastal communities.
marine,low,Encourage sustainable tourism and habitat restoration grants for small-scale coastal conservation projects.
